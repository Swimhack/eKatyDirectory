**Body:**

Hi E-Star Chinese Buffet Katy team,

I noticed E-Star Chinese Buffet Katy doesn't have a website - **that's costing you customers every single day.**

**Here's what's happening:**
• 10,000+ people search for restaurants in Katy every month
• They find your phone number on Google
• But there's NO website to learn about your menu, hours, or specials
• **85% of them go to a competitor with a website instead**

**Good news: We already built you a FREE website.**

✅ Google Maps integration
✅ Customer reviews
✅ Hours of operation
✅ Professional photos (from Google)

3. Start getting more customers

## EMAIL 2: Follow-Up (Day 3)

**Subject:** Re: E-Star Chinese Buffet Katy - Quick question

**Preview:** Just following up on the eKaty opportunity. Any questions?

**Body:**

Hi E-Star Chinese Buffet Katy team,

I sent you an email a few days ago about getting more visibility on eKaty.com.

**Quick question:** What's holding you back from claiming your profile?

Is it:
→ Not sure it's worth it?
→ Too busy right now?
→ Want to see proof it works?
→ Have questions about pricing?

Let me know and I'll help!

Also, here are some quick stats from this week:
• 12,450 restaurant searches on eKaty.com
• 4,200 "kids eat free" searches
• 2,800 "happy hour near me" searches
• 1,500 "Chinese" searches

Your competitors are capturing these customers.

Want to grab your share?

Best,
James

P.S. - Still offering 50% off first month for quick decisions!

## EMAIL 3: Last Chance (Day 7)

**Subject:** [FINAL] E-Star Chinese Buffet Katy - Your spot is about to be taken

**Preview:** Last chance for 50% off Featured placement. Offer expires in 48 hours.

**Body:**

Hi E-Star Chinese Buffet Katy team,

**This is my last email.**

I've reached out a couple times about getting E-Star Chinese Buffet Katy featured on eKaty.com.

**Here's the situation:**
• We have limited Featured spots available
• Your competitors are signing up
• The 50% off offer expires in 48 hours
• After that, full price ($99/month) or the spot goes to someone else

**Decision time:**
→ Say YES: Get featured, capture 10,000+ monthly diners, grow revenue
→ Say NO: Stay invisible while competitors win

No hard feelings either way, but I wanted to give you one last chance before offering your spot to the next restaurant on our waitlist.

**Reply "YES" to this email or click below to claim your spot:**

Best,
James

P.S. - Even if you're not interested in Featured, at least claim your FREE profile so you show up in search results. Takes 2 minutes:
