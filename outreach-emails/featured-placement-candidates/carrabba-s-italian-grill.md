## EMAIL 1: Initial Outreach (Day 0)

**Subject:** Carrabba's Italian Grill: You're a Top Restaurant in Katy (Make It Official) ⭐

**Preview:** 4.5/5 with 2658+ reviews. Get featured placement to capture more searches.

**Body:**

Hi Carrabba's Italian Grill team,

Congratulations! Carrabba's Italian Grill is officially one of the **top-rated restaurants in Katy** with your 4.5/5 rating and 2658+ reviews.

**Here's what your customers are saying about you:**
"Best Bar,Meal Takeaway in Katy!" - Verified Customer

**But here's the problem:**
When people search "best restaurants in Katy" on Google and eKaty.com, you're not showing up in the top results - **even though you deserve to be.**

**Why?** Because lower-rated competitors are paying for featured placement.

**The Solution:**
Get Featured Placement for $99/month and dominate search results.

**What Featured Placement Gets You:**
✅ **Top of Search Results** - First restaurant people see
✅ **Homepage Featured Carousel** - 10,000+ monthly impressions
✅ **"Editor's Pick" Badge** - Instant credibility boost
✅ **Email Spotlights** - Sent to 5,000+ local foodies
✅ **Priority in "Best of Katy" Lists** - Media exposure

**Real ROI:**
Average featured restaurant sees **$3,000+ in additional monthly revenue** from eKaty referrals.

**That's a 30x return on a $99/month investment.**

**Limited Availability:**
We only feature 20 restaurants total to maintain exclusivity and quality.

**Currently: 7 spots remaining**

Want to claim your spot before your competitors do?

**Body:**

Hi Carrabba's Italian Grill team,

I sent you an email a few days ago about getting more visibility on eKaty.com.

**Quick question:** What's holding you back from claiming your profile?

Is it:
→ Not sure it's worth it?
→ Too busy right now?
→ Want to see proof it works?
→ Have questions about pricing?

Let me know and I'll help!

Also, here are some quick stats from this week:
• 12,450 restaurant searches on eKaty.com
• 4,200 "kids eat free" searches
• 2,800 "happy hour near me" searches
• 1,500 "Bar,Meal Takeaway" searches

Your competitors are capturing these customers.

Want to grab your share?

Best,
James

## EMAIL 3: Last Chance (Day 7)

**Subject:** [FINAL] Carrabba's Italian Grill - Your spot is about to be taken

**Preview:** Last chance for 50% off Featured placement. Offer expires in 48 hours.

**Body:**

Hi Carrabba's Italian Grill team,

**This is my last email.**

I've reached out a couple times about getting Carrabba's Italian Grill featured on eKaty.com.

**Here's the situation:**
• We have limited Featured spots available
• Your competitors are signing up
• The 50% off offer expires in 48 hours
• After that, full price ($99/month) or the spot goes to someone else

**Decision time:**
→ Say YES: Get featured, capture 10,000+ monthly diners, grow revenue
→ Say NO: Stay invisible while competitors win

No hard feelings either way, but I wanted to give you one last chance before offering your spot to the next restaurant on our waitlist.

**Reply "YES" to this email or click below to claim your spot:**

Best,
James
