**Body:**

Hi Chang's Chinese Restaurant team,

I sent you an email a few days ago about getting more visibility on eKaty.com.

**Quick question:** What's holding you back from claiming your profile?

Is it:
→ Not sure it's worth it?
→ Too busy right now?
→ Want to see proof it works?
→ Have questions about pricing?

Let me know and I'll help!

Also, here are some quick stats from this week:
• 12,450 restaurant searches on eKaty.com
• 4,200 "kids eat free" searches
• 2,800 "happy hour near me" searches
• 1,500 "Restaurant" searches

Your competitors are capturing these customers.

Want to grab your share?

Best,

## EMAIL 3: Last Chance (Day 7)

**Subject:** [FINAL] Chang's Chinese Restaurant - Your spot is about to be taken

**Preview:** Last chance for 50% off Featured placement. Offer expires in 48 hours.

**Body:**

Hi Chang's Chinese Restaurant team,

**This is my last email.**

I've reached out a couple times about getting Chang's Chinese Restaurant featured on eKaty.com.

**Here's the situation:**
• We have limited Featured spots available
• Your competitors are signing up
• The 50% off offer expires in 48 hours
• After that, full price ($99/month) or the spot goes to someone else

**Decision time:**
→ Say YES: Get featured, capture 10,000+ monthly diners, grow revenue
→ Say NO: Stay invisible while competitors win

No hard feelings either way, but I wanted to give you one last chance before offering your spot to the next restaurant on our waitlist.

**Reply "YES" to this email or click below to claim your spot:**

Best,
James
